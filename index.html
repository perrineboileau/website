			<h2> What is Musical ?</h2>
			<p>
				Musical ESSEC is a musical theater club founded in 1998 by a group of ambitious and passionate students. The project has kept growing ever since and Musical is now one of ESSEC Business School's best-recognized student associations. 
				Each year, a team of 50 students - exclusively in Management, from first to last year - entirely creates and produces an original musical theater play : script, play, songs, lyrics, choreographies, costumes and stage set.  
				The semi-professional productions are put together in 8 months of intense writing, composing and rehearsing. The club performs its show in some of the most renowned and largest Parisian venues: Olympia, Folies Berg√®re, Casino de Paris and La Cigale.
